Assignment Overview
This assignment explores security primitives and attacks using cryptography. It involves answering questions on cryptanalysis of substitution ciphers and block cipher operation modes, with an option to use programming methods and AI models like ChatGPT.

Questions and Guidelines
1. Cryptanalysis on Substitution Ciphers
Task: Decrypt a given ciphertext.
Approach: Demonstrate the process of finding at least five plaintext letters.
2. Block Cipher and Operation Modes
Focus: Demonstrating the Counter (CTR) mode of AES encryption.
Steps:
Create a 256-bit key starting with your student ID and a 512-bit plaintext, both in hexadecimal.
Specify a non-trivial Initialisation Vector (IV).
Demonstrate the encryption of each block in CTR-AES.
Show the complete 512-bit ciphertext.
Investigate the avalanche effect of AES using a single block with different plaintext inputs.
